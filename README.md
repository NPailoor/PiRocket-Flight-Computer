# The PiRocket Flight Computer

Welcome! This is a project formed in Robert Winglee's *Rockets and Instrumentation* class at the University of Washington. Our goal is to make a high-altitude, high-velocity telemetry and communication computer based on a Raspberry Pi Zero and some Python.

## Goals

This is a very dynamic project. To manage this well, we will be using Github's [issue tracking](https://github.com/aaron235/PiRocket-Flight-Computer/issues) to create, manage, and complete goals.

## Time Frame

Again, the project is very dynamic. We will be using Github's [milestones](https://github.com/aaron235/PiRocket-Flight-Computer/milestones) for this.

## Materials

We are using the Raspberry Pi Zero, because it is a really good platform for smart embedded project with a space constraint. [Satanowski's Pi Zero Watcher](http://rpi0.satanowski.net/) is a good place to find out where you can get one. For sensors, we are primarily using [Adafruit's sensors](https://www.adafruit.com/category/35) due to their well-documented and easy-to-use Python libraries for the Raspberry Pi.

## Required Learning

There's a lot to know. Most users/contributors will probably not know how to do every single part of the project. A good list of things you might want to brush up on is:

* Python
* Electronics
* SSH
* Linux/systemd
* Git

There is more, but with a basic understanding of some or all of these things, you should be able to get up and go with very little stress. Check the documentation to make this easier.
